    Recursion is very imp, It's concepts extends for dynamic programming also.
    
    def greet():
        print("punam")
    it will not run 
    we need to call 
    
    Function = when a function calls itslef it is called recursion.
    def greet():
        print("punam")
        greet()
    This will call but it will not stop so it is infinite recursion. 
    And it gives Stack Overflow error.
    Though it goes at 987 recursion for then python will throw stack overflow error.
